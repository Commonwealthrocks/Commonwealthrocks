### **Who am I?**
If you've never heard about me, hi. I'm **Common** or **Commonwealthrocks** or **TheCommonWealth** or... whatever alias I was using that day.
I'm a self taught programmer that works in *many* languages including **Python**, **C**, **C++**, **JavaScript**, **Rust**, **Assembly (x64 and x86)**.

Now you're *probablyyyy* thinking *"Oh cool, now what do you do?"*
Which uhh... yeah fair enough, onto that!!

### **Before hand**
Before you go on, you must know *one* thing. I am a **Windows** developer; in other words I do not work with **Linux**, **macOS** or any **UNIX** system in general. I do a best effort for **Linux** but I never promise it shall work.

### **Python**
**[![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.12-3776AB.svg?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org)**

My go to language for basically anything; can't mess up with it. **Python** with it's vast community and libraries like `cryptography`, `discord`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and so on. All have their specific use case, but which ones do I use?

So far, **PyLI** is my *only* public project for **Python** and any other language. If you want more information you can go about and read it from the link.

#### **[Use of cryptography (PyLI)](https://github.com/Commonwealthrocks/PyLI/)**

With that I also use **Python** for multi-media work, encryption (as seen), **Discord** bots and so on.

### **C / C++**
**![C/C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2FC++-00599C?style=flat&logo=c&logoColor=white)**

**C** or **C++**, I use both depending on the scenario but their main use is for low level stuff that can not be done with a high level language like **Python** or and emulated language.
Most common uses case for me in these languages are when directly doing `sys` calls and manual tweaks. Libraries like `Qt` **(C++)** are useful for fast-er GUI if needed unlike **Python** dynamic `PySide6` slow counterpart.

For my compilers I use `GCC` and `G++` with `UCRT64`; only for uses like **Cython** I use `MSVC`.

### JavaScript
**![Javascript](https://badges.frapsoft.com/javascript/code/javascript.svg?v=101)**

Honestly, I despise **JavaScript** with and without a passion but in the rare use cases I do work with it; it's only for web development currently. As for the future of me using this language it is unknown.


### **Rust**
**![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000.svg?style=flat&logo=rust)**

Similar use case with **C / C++**, **Rust** is fast, compiled and it's benefactor; safe. My most use case for this is when I am coding something that might send my computer into Narnia. Very useful for seeing how code is safe / unsafe; the compile times got me fucking tweaking though.

### **Assembly (x64 and x86)**
![Assembly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Assembly-525252.svg?style=flat&logo=windows-terminal&logoColor=white)

![x86](https://img.shields.io/badge/x86-0078D6.svg?style=flat&logo=intel&logoColor=white)

![x64](https://img.shields.io/badge/x64-0071C5.svg?style=flat&logo=amd&logoColor=white)

They say you can't spell **Assembly** without `ass`, and they are right because this language *SUCKS* in terms of working with it. Anyways to real use cases, the only thing I use this for is bootloaders; 512 byte bootloaders on an **x64** CPU. Or I use it for general `sys` work that needs **Assembly** on **Windows** to work.

### **What I am CURRENTLY working on**
So far, my main project is **PyLI**; open source encryption software WITH compression... again more can be seen at the link above if you haven't seen.

Other than that no other project o' mine is for viewing; but I can assure in the future there shall be more to see from me. After all I have a life to balance too and do most of my work solo.
