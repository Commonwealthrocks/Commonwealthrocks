## **Hello our dear World...**
Sometimes it's our turns to talk. And now it shall be mine.

### **Who am I?**
If you've never heard about me, hi. I'm **Common** or **Commonwealthrocks** or **TheCommonWealth** or... whatever alias I was using that day.
I'm a self taught programmer that works in *many* languages including **Python**, **C**, **C++**, **JavaScript**, **Rust**, **Assembly (x64 and x86)**.

Now you're *def* thinking *"Oh cool, now what do you do?"*
Which... yeah fair enough, onto that.

### **Before hand**
Before you go on, you must know *one* thing. I am a **Windows** developer; in other words I do not work with **Linux**, **macOS** or any **UNIX** system in general. I do a best effort for **Linux** but I never promise it shall work.

### **Python**
**[![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.12-3776AB.svg?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org)**

My go to language for basically anything; can't mess up with it. **Python** with it's vast community and libraries like `cryptography`, `discord`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and so on. All have their specific use case, but which ones do I use?

So far, **PyKryptor** is my *only* public project for **Python** and any other language. If you want more information you can go about and read it from the link.

With that I also use **Python** for multi-media work, encryption (as seen), **Discord** bots and so on.

### **C / C++**
**![C/C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2FC++-00599C?style=flat&logo=c&logoColor=white)**

**C** or **C++**, I use both depending on the scenario but their main use is for low level stuff that can not be done with a high level language like **Python** or and emulated language.
Most common uses case for me in these languages are when directly doing `sys` calls and manual tweaks. Libraries like `Qt` **(C++)** are useful for fast-er GUI if needed unlike **Python** dynamic `PySide6` slow counterpart.

For my compilers I use `GCC` and `G++` with `UCRT64`; only for uses like **Cython** I use `MSVC`.

### JavaScript
**![Javascript](https://badges.frapsoft.com/javascript/code/javascript.svg?v=101)**

Honestly, I despise **JavaScript** with and without a passion but in the rare use cases I do work with it; it's only for web development currently. As for the future of me using this language it is unknown.

### **Rust**
**![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000.svg?style=flat&logo=rust)**

Similar use case with **C / C++**, **Rust** is fast, compiled and it's benefactor; safe. I mostly use **Rust** because of it's compiler since it can save me a headache or two with segfaults but gives me another one when I need to fix my code... **Rust** in my use cases is also very bad for big files or projects; the compile times are not a nice thing. So it's better to use it on smaller bits of code.

### **Assembly (x64 and x86)**
![Assembly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Assembly-525252.svg?style=flat&logo=windows-terminal&logoColor=white)

![x64](https://img.shields.io/badge/x64-ED1C24.svg?style=flat&logo=amd&logoColor=white)

They say ̶ ̶m̶y̶ ̶h̶u̶n̶g̶e̶r̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶a̶ ̶p̶r̶o̶b̶l̶e̶m̶  you can't spell **Assembly** without `ass`. And to that I fully agree this language is *horrid* in terms of enjoyment from using it; however it is useful for the closest you will have by talking with the CPU. Bootloaders, kernels, low level file / HEX management, that's my main use of **Assembly**.

In general **Assembly** is very architecture dependent, so I only reach for it when high level languages won't cut it.

### **What I am CURRENTLY working on**
"So far, my main project is **PyKryptor**; open source encryption software WITH compression... again more can be seen at the link above if you haven't seen."

Yeah well scrap THAT since I did make a new project finally; **CommonDoesThings**, not as good as **PyKryptor** but it sure is interesting and I plan to use it myself!

In short **CommonDoesThings** is a **Python** library made in **C**, you can see the full `README.md` at the repo under **PyKryptor**.

I would prefer more *serious* questions; but I don't mind weird ones too :)
