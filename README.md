## **Hello our dear World...**
Sometimes it's our turns to talk. And now it shall be mine.

### **Who am I?**
If you've never heard about me, hi. I'm **Common** or **Commonwealthrocks** or **TheCommonWealth** or... whatever alias I was using that day.
I'm a self taught programmer that works in *many* languages including **Python**, **C**, **C++**, **JavaScript**, **Rust**, **Assembly (x64 and x86)**.

Now you're *def* thinking *"Oh cool, now what do you do?"*
Which... yeah fair enough, onto that.

### **Before hand**
Before you go on, you must know *one* thing. I am a **Windows** developer; in other words I do not work with **Linux**, **macOS** or any **UNIX** system in general. I do a best effort for **Linux** but I never promise it shall work.

### **Python**
**[![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.12-3776AB.svg?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org)**

My go to language for basically anything; can't mess up with it. **Python** with it's vast community and libraries like `cryptography`, `discord`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and so on. All have their specific use case, but which ones do I use?

So far, **PyLI** is my *only* public project for **Python** and any other language. If you want more information you can go about and read it from the link.

#### **[Use of cryptography (PyLI)](https://github.com/Commonwealthrocks/PyLI/)**

With that I also use **Python** for multi-media work, encryption (as seen), **Discord** bots and so on.

### **C / C++**
**![C/C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2FC++-00599C?style=flat&logo=c&logoColor=white)**

**C** or **C++**, I use both depending on the scenario but their main use is for low level stuff that can not be done with a high level language like **Python** or and emulated language.
Most common uses case for me in these languages are when directly doing `sys` calls and manual tweaks. Libraries like `Qt` **(C++)** are useful for fast-er GUI if needed unlike **Python** dynamic `PySide6` slow counterpart.

For my compilers I use `GCC` and `G++` with `UCRT64`; only for uses like **Cython** I use `MSVC`.

### JavaScript
**![Javascript](https://badges.frapsoft.com/javascript/code/javascript.svg?v=101)**

Honestly, I despise **JavaScript** with and without a passion but in the rare use cases I do work with it; it's only for web development currently. As for the future of me using this language it is unknown.

### **Rust**
**![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000.svg?style=flat&logo=rust)**

Similar use case with **C / C++**, **Rust** is fast, compiled and it's benefactor; safe. I mostly use **Rust** because of it's compiler since it can save me a headache or two with segfaults but gives me another one when I need to fix my code... **Rust** in my use cases is also very bad for big files or projects; the compile times are not a nice thing. So it's better to use it on smaller bits of code.

### **Assembly (x64 and x86)**
![Assembly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Assembly-525252.svg?style=flat&logo=windows-terminal&logoColor=white)

![x86](https://img.shields.io/badge/x86-0078D6.svg?style=flat&logo=intel&logoColor=white)

![x64](https://img.shields.io/badge/x64-ED1C24.svg?style=flat&logo=amd&logoColor=white)

They say ̶ ̶m̶y̶ ̶h̶u̶n̶g̶e̶r̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶a̶ ̶p̶r̶o̶b̶l̶e̶m̶  you can't spell **Assembly** without `ass`. And to that I fully agree this language is *horrid* in terms of enjoyment from using it; however it is useful for the closest you will have by talking with the CPU. Bootloaders, kernels, low level file / HEX management, that's my main use of **Assembly**.

In general **Assembly** is very architecture dependent, so I only reach for it when high level languages won't cut it.

### **What I am CURRENTLY working on**
So far, my main project is **PyLI**; open source encryption software WITH compression... again more can be seen at the link above if you haven't seen.

Other than that you can expect more projects very soon for viewing!

### **Get in touch**
I would prefer more *serious* questions; but I don't mind weird ones too :)
